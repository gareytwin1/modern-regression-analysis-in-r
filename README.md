# Modern Regression Analysis in R

This repository contains coursework and notes from the CU-Boulder Data Science program for Modern Regression Analysis in R. The course covers multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling, statistical inference, model selection, diagnostics, and ethical statistical communication.

## About This Repository

This is a collection of learning materials, code examples, and projects related to modern regression analysis techniques using the R programming language. The content aligns with the curriculum from the University of Colorado Boulder's Data Science program.

## Topics Covered

- **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Modeling**: Building and interpreting regression models with multiple predictors
- **Statistical Inference**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values in regression contexts
- **Model Selection**: Techniques for choosing the best model including forward/backward selection, AIC, BIC
- **Regression Diagnostics**: Residual analysis, outlier detection, influence measures, and assumption checking
- **Ethical Statistical Communication**: Best practices for presenting and interpreting statistical results responsibly

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows (structure will evolve as content is added):

```
modern-regression-analysis-in-r/
├── README.md           # This file
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore configuration
└── [Future content directories to be added]
```

## Prerequisites

To work with the materials in this repository, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of R programming
- Understanding of fundamental statistics (mean, variance, distributions)
- Familiarity with simple linear regression
- R and RStudio installed on your computer

### Recommended R Packages

Common packages used in regression analysis:
- `ggplot2` - Data visualization
- `dplyr` - Data manipulation
- `tidyr` - Data tidying
- `broom` - Convert statistical objects into tidy format
- `car` - Companion to Applied Regression
- `MASS` - Modern Applied Statistics with S

You can install these packages in R using:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "broom", "car", "MASS"))
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gareytwin1/modern-regression-analysis-in-r.git
   cd modern-regression-analysis-in-r
   ```

2. Open the project in RStudio or your preferred R environment

3. Navigate through the materials as they are added to the repository

## Usage

As materials are added to this repository, each section will include:
- R scripts with code examples
- Markdown files with notes and explanations
- Data files for practice and examples
- Project files demonstrating concepts
